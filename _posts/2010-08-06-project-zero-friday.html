Yesterday was spent hefting boxes and constructing bookcases. I'll be glad when we wrap up the unpacking and furniture purchases sometime next week.<br /><br />Today I've been putting the finishing touches on the blog and associated pages. I've decided to go with something simple for now, mostly because I've realized that I lack an eye for design and layout. Among other things, I'm hopeful 50 projects will force me to get better at skills I've never taken the time to develop. Design, layout and art of any kind have been things I've shied away from for a long time. Hopefully I'll get a chance to exercise some of those long forgotten muscles. <br /><br />That being said <span style="font-family: Times,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Times New Roman </span>and <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">Courier</span> are perfectly readable fonts and should be used more often. But I'm a sucker for <span style="font-family: Times,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Serifs</span>.</div>

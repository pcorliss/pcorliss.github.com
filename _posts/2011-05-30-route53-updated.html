I've just updated the route53 gem to support Amazon's latest additions including weighted resource record sets as well as zone apex support allowing assignment of ELB instances to roots of domains. It's like allowing a CNAME of the naked domain to an ELB instance which was previously unavailable to folks using EC2.<br /><br />This is probably the most successful tool I've put together to date. With 75 watchers and 10 forks on github as well as over <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/route53/stats">2000 downloads</a> and counting from rubygems. I look forwarding to continue improving the project and keeping up with the new features as Amazon releases them.<br /><br /><a href="https://github.com/pcorliss/ruby_route_53">https://github.com/pcorliss/ruby_route_53</a></div>

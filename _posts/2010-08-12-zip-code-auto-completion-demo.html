This portion took a little longer than expected due to some issues with getting the last pieces of furniture around the new apartment delivered and installed. But I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. I used <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> for the jsonp requests and <a href="http://jqueryui.com/">jQuery UI</a> for the auto complete feature.<br /><br />I'll be refining it today and tomorrow with a release target of Friday night. <br /><br /><iframe frameborder=0 src ="http://zip.50projects.com" width="100%" height="300"><br /><p>Looks like the iframe isn't working. You can go here instead <a href="http://zip.50projects.com/zipcode_auto.html">http://zip.50projects.com</a></p></iframe></div>

I put in a bogus zip code and it seems to just keep spinning indefinitely. A fast &quot;lrn 2 type&quot; return would be more useful.</div>

No GeoIP targeting. But it does sort zip codes by most to least populous via data from the 2000 census.</div>

I like it!  Does it use any sort of IP address input for intelligent suggesting?  That might be neat.  Either way, pretty dang neat!</div>

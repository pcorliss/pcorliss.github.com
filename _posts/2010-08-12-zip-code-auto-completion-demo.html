This portion took a little longer than expected due to some issues with getting the last pieces of furniture around the new apartment delivered and installed. But I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. I used <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> for the jsonp requests and <a href="http://jqueryui.com/">jQuery UI</a> for the auto complete feature.<br /><br />I'll be refining it today and tomorrow with a release target of Friday night. <br /><br /><iframe frameborder=0 src ="http://zip.50projects.com" width="100%" height="300"><br /><p>Looks like the iframe isn't working. You can go here instead <a href="http://zip.50projects.com/zipcode_auto.html">http://zip.50projects.com</a></p></iframe></div>

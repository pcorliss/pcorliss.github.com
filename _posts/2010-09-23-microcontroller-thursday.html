I meant to post this yesterday when it was filmed but it slipped my mind. This is the first portion of this weeks project. Unfortunately I had intended to solder this on to a circuit board for a more permanent setup but the chip socket I had wouldn't accommodate the teensy's pins. I just got some more headers in the mail so I'll give those a try Friday or Saturday.<br /><br />I also received some small push button switches, which I'll have to integrate to provide more preset lighting options.<br /><br /><object height="385" width="480"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/pI2g945pEy0?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/pI2g945pEy0?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"></embed></object></div>

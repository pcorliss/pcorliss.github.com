Initially this project was designed to be a method of attracting search engine traffic by aggregating popular content but I'm doubtful that it will attract enough traffic to generate significant revenue. Despite that it's up and running and pulling in content from multiple sources and for multiple subjects.<br /><br />I'm not excited about the design. It definitely lacks any flare. But as far as basic features it does what it's supposed to. RSS aggregation, display of popular articles only, multiple subjects, etc..<br /><br />You can check it out at <a href="http://aggie.50projects.com/">http://aggie.50projects.com</a></div>

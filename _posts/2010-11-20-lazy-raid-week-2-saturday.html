I was able to integrate the <a href="http://www.cs.utk.edu/%7Eplank/plank/papers/CS-08-627.html">Jerasure</a> library into the existing <a href="https://github.com/pcorliss/LazyRaid">LazyRaid</a> code. However about 1 in 20 recovery attempts fail consistently. I spent Tuesday through Thursday troubleshooting the issue and wasn't able to track down the problem. I finished integrating it but a redundancy solution that only successfully recovers something 19/20 times isn't much of a redundancy solution. For now singly disk redundancy will have to be okay.<br /><br />Additionally packaging the application for Windows has proven to be an issue as well. Tools like <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/ocra/">ocra</a> and RubyScript2Exe don't want to work without major tweaking and I just don't have the patience. For now a separate branch will be available with the compiled windows .so library for the xor calculation. Compiling it was another amazing hassle. Ruby and windows just doesn't seem to mix.<br /><br />So in summary no working significant code released this week. Plenty of non-working code is available on the jerasure branch on github though.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><a href="https://github.com/pcorliss/LazyRaid/tree/jerasure" style="color: #2a5db0;" target="_blank">https://github.com/pcorliss/<wbr></wbr>LazyRaid/tree/jerasure</a> (NOT FUNCTIONAL! do not use for production data)<br /><br />Check the windows branch for the compiled dll and modified disk handling code. <a href="https://github.com/pcorliss/LazyRaid/tree/windows" style="color: #2a5db0;" target="_blank">https://github.com/pcorliss/<wbr></wbr>LazyRaid/tree/windows</a></span></span><br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: separate; color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: small; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Tomorrow I'll post the XOR speed comparison between ruby and the native C library I wrote to handle the XOR calculation.</span></span></div>

Signed, sealed and not quite delivered. The site is finished and working to my satisfaction but I'll be shelving it for now in favor of waiting for a point where I can devote more marketing resources to it. It has potential but requires a critical mass of puzzles, developers and recruiters to be viable. I'll keep you folks updated.<br /><br />In the meantime watch out for tomorrows post. All signs point to large scale data processing with hadoop.</div>

<div class='post'>
This week I'll be going back to ruby and devleoping a rails application. Primarily so that I'm not not totally lost when I attend <a href="http://windycityrails.org/%20">Windy City Rails</a> on Saturday. I'll also be targeting a much smaller scope than last week. But with greater emphasis on bells and whistles that are conceived of during development. Potentially this will also lay some of the groundwork for another project down the line involving consumer video.<br /><br /><b>Project Summary:</b> Build a webapp using Ruby on Rails to enable strings of videos to play continuously without interruption.<br /><br /><b>Planned Features:</b><br /><ul><li>YouTube Integration</li><li>Generate Embed Codes</li><li>Short URL generator</li><li>Bells and Whistles</li></ul><b>Monetization:</b><br /><ul><li>Google AdSense</li></ul><b>If There's Time:</b><br /><ul><li>Integration with other video services</li><li>Video Aggregator</li></ul></div>

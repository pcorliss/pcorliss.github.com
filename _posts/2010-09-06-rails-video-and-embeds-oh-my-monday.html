<div class='post'>
This week I'll be going back to ruby and devleoping a rails application. Primarily so that I'm not not totally lost when I attend <a href="http://windycityrails.org/%20">Windy City Rails</a> on Saturday. I'll also be targeting a much smaller scope than last week. But with greater emphasis on bells and whistles that are conceived of during development. Potentially this will also lay some of the groundwork for another project down the line involving consumer video.<br /><br /><b>Project Summary:</b> Build a webapp using Ruby on Rails to enable strings of videos to play continuously without interruption.<br /><br /><b>Planned Features:</b><br /><ul><li>YouTube Integration</li><li>Generate Embed Codes</li><li>Short URL generator</li><li>Bells and Whistles</li></ul><b>Monetization:</b><br /><ul><li>Google AdSense</li></ul><b>If There's Time:</b><br /><ul><li>Integration with other video services</li><li>Video Aggregator</li></ul></div>

Starting with Rails 2.3.8. Rails 3 installation is a bit of a pain on my linux system. I was going to try to port it later in the week.</div>

Are you delving into Rails 3 by chance?<br /><br /><br />If not I highly recommend you do!  <br /><br /><br />Also have fun at Windy City Rails! Regional conferences are way better than the huge ones like RailsConf imho...</div>

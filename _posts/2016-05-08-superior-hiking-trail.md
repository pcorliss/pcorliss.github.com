A few months ago I was captivated by a reddit IAMA [Last year I quit my job in order to walk the 2650 mile PCT](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/48rv22/last_year_i_quit_my_job_in_order_to_walk_the_2650/)

The idea of travel makes me anxious: too many people, being unable to speak the language, etc... But the idea of lots of solitary time, getting daily exercise, seeing the stars without [light pollution](http://darksitefinder.com/maps/world.html), and some of the most striking scenery that the US has to offer.

### A Few Wrinkles:

* I like my job, and don’t feel too keen on leaving.
* I don’t think I’m quite up to the task of spending 4 months backpacking without a test run.
* All of my gear is from my time in the Boy Scouts, sized for an adolescent, and about 19 years old.
* What if nostalgia is clouding my memory of backpacking?

Clearly a test-hike is in order. The Chicago area, while largely flat, isn’t much for long wilderness trails. But a short plane ride away is Minnesota and the [Superior Hiking Trail](http://www.shta.org/).

The trail is 251 miles, from Duluth to the Canadian border along Lake Superior’s coast. Roughly 2-weeks of hiking 20 miles a day, a resupply or two part way through, and I can call myself adequately prepared for something more ambitious.

As a Boy Scout I was packing 40-50 lbs up and down the mountains of the Pacific Northwest. The longest hike I went on was a 9-day 63 mile hike around the Pasayten Wilderness. I’m in better shape as an adult than I was as a kid. Technology has advanced such that a base-weight of 10-15lbs is now possible. I’ll be fighting 35-year-old-knees but I like my odds.

### New Gear

Mobile phones were available when I was backpacking. But typically service was unavailable until you got back to the trail-head. Now smart phones offer GPS, maps, compass, still photos, and video recording. But powering all that on a long-distance hike can be a challenge.

Enter the [16,100 mAh AmazonBasics Portable Power Bank](http://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Portable-Power-Bank-100/dp/B00ZQ4JQAA?ie=UTF8&psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00).

It managed to fully recharge my iPhone from a normal day’s usage (50%) 8 times. With low-power and airplane-mode I’m certain I can stretch that to two full weeks. At 12.6 oz it’s heavy but well worth the piece of mind.

I’ll be posting periodic updates as I acquire and test new gear, Get my inventory together and firm up my plans.

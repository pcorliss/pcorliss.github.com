Back from vacation refreshed and ready to start on another project. This week I'll be working on a site to help travelers understand the security measures in place in airports and what their options are. For example I flew through Chicago's Midway airport and the Ft. Lauderdale airport on my trip and didn't encounter one of the now infamous backscatter x-ray machines. I did however get my hands swabbed and run through what I think was a gas spectrometer looking for chemical traces of explosives and saw a senior citzen getting patted down thouroughly by a TSA agent. This seems like information an informed flier may want access to prior to flying.<br /><br /><b>Project Summary: </b>Develop a web app to provide information on specific airport security and TSA requirements.<br /><b><br />Features:</b><br /><ul><li>Import a list of all airports world wide.</li><li>Track down passenger volume data for sorting purposes.</li><li>Allow users to provide updates.</li></ul></div>

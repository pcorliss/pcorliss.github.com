Over the last 5 months I've done a lot of work that I'm proud of. However the revenue and traffic has been far lower than even my most conservative estimates. I think I'm a decent software developer but I am not a marketer. At this point my finances are stable enough that I could continue doing 50projects for the entire year and then some but I just don't feel comfortable not collecting a paycheck. With that said I'll be starting a job search at the beginning of the new year. I've already put together a short of list of companies in the Chicago area I'll be pursuing. In addition I'm open to entertaining contract software development opportunities so please feel free to <a href="http://blog.50projects.com/p/contact.html">contact me</a> if you know someone that is looking for a developer in the Chicago area or is open to telecommuting and/or light travel.<br /><br />I'll post my resume shortly but my <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/philipcorliss">linkedin profile</a> is a good approximation.<br /><br />Until I accept a position I'll continue to do weekly projects and post the results on 50projects but the scope may be reduced as I go on interviews. Afterwards I may move to a more relaxed style of 2-4 week projects spread out over more than one year. But I fully intend to continue posting updates and releasing projects.</div>

I hate to say it, but marketing is critical to success. It&#39;s so rare that something succeeds without great effort in getting the word out. Maybe you should seek your counterpart in the marketing world. The &quot;I can market anything&quot; guy.<br /><br />Good luck and Happy Festivus,<br /><br />David</div>

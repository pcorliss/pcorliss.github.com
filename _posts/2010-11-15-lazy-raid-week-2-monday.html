My partner is on vacation this week so I figured I'd take a little breather as well and instead of working on a fresh project it was time to refine this one some more.<br /><br />I'll be targeting some big ticket features such as a GUI and double disk failure as well as some simpler stuff like unit tests and better error handling.<br /><br /><b>Features:</b><br /><ul><li>Double Disk Failure</li><li>Desktop GUI</li><li>Cross-Platform Distribution for Mac, Windows and Linux.</li><li>Unit Tests</li><li>Robust Error Handling</li></ul></div>

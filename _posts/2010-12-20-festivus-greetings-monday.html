Prior to moving to Chicago I threw the wildest, most extravagant Festivus parties every year during the holiday season [citation needed]. We deep fried turkeys, had a toasty fire going, served copious amounts of alcohol and adhered to the strict traditions of a made up holiday. There was a poll which pictures were taken with, an airing of grievances and Festivus wasn't over until the host was pinned. Truly a marvelous holiday.<br /><br />This year I'll be away from my friends in a strange city but I still want the Festivus cheer to be a part of my life. So this week's project will center around developing a site and backend components to allow people to post their Festivus greetings and grievances.<br /><br /><b>Project Summary:</b> Website to allow users to view and post their festivus greetings.<br /><b><br />Features:</b><br /><ul><li>Greeting Playback</li><li>Built in browser based webcam recording</li><li>RTMP stream handling to back browser based webcam recording</li><li>Youtube and Vimeo integration</li></ul></div>

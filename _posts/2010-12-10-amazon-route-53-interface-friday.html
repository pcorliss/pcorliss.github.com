<div class='post'>
After a few days of tweaking I'm happy to say that I've ferreted out all the obvious bugs and things are looking good. The ruby interface to Amazon's Route 53 can officially be called "Released". Complete with a command line interface as well as a module for inclusion in other ruby projects. All packaged up nice and neat in my first gem.<br /><br />You can find the source and documentation at <a href="https://github.com/pcorliss/ruby_route_53">https://github.com/pcorliss/ruby_route_53</a><br /><br />Bug reports should either go to me or to the Issues page on github.<br /><br />If you already have the gem installed you'll want to run<br /><br /><code>sudo gem update route53</code><br /><br />Otherwise<br /><br /><code>sudo gem install route53</code></div>

Great. Just no tests so I can verify this still works in 2012.</div>

Fantastic. This beats the heck out of the thin Perl wrapper around curl that Amazon touts in their getting started tutorial. Very clean command line tool.</div>

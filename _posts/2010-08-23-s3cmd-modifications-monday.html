<div class='post'>
This week I'm going to work on one of the <a href="http://blog.50projects.com/2010/08/intelligent-address-entry-released.html">pain points</a>&nbsp;I ran into during the zip code project. Specifically <a href="http://s3tools.org/">s3cmd</a>&nbsp;lacks a few features that would be nice to have. After completion I'll see if the project owners are interested in integrating my changes back into the original product.<br /><br /><b>Project Summary:&nbsp;</b>Modify the s3cmd project to support new features and expand on old ones. Contribute modifications back to the community.<br /><br /><b>Features</b><ul><li>Cloudfront Default Root Object Support</li><li>Parralel Uploads and Downloads</li><li>Better support for very large buckets and files</li><li>Automatic file splitting and joining of large files (&gt; 2Gb)</li><li>s3sync local caching</li></ul><br /><b>If There's Time</b><ul><li>Look at the s3fuse project as well as s3cmd and see if that could be worked on.</li></ul></div>

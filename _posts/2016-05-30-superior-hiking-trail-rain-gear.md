I was fortunate to find the [Marmot PreCip](https://marmot.com/products/details/precip-jacket-new) jacket and pants on sale and picked them both up. [Reviewers give it high marks](http://www.outdoorgearlab.com/Rain-Jacket-Reviews/Marmot-PreCip) and inexpensive is a combination I can't resist.

Shortly after I picked it up we had a perfect Saturday here in Chicago. My SO was at work, the it was above freezing, windy, and raining.


I'm sure I looked a bit odd trudging up the [Lakefront Trail](http://www.choosechicago.com/articles/view/THE-LAKEFRONT-TRAIL/454/) in the rain with a pack on my back but it needed to be done.

14-miles there and back, it was a good test. I ended up staying mostly dry. The places I ended up getting wet were my trail runners, which aren't supposed to be waterproof, but also drained well. I neglected to bring gloves and ended up with some wet and cold hands. I also left my waterproof pants back pocket unzipped, didn't realize it until I got home, and found the right-side of my behind soaked.

I did find out that my pack is definitely not waterproof. It even collected a couple of inches of water on the inside which I had to pour out in the sink. I've obtained a waterproof pack cover which should fix that problem up.

Here's hoping my trip on the Superior Hiking Trail will be clear and dry, but at least I know Iâ€™ll be prepared if it isn't.

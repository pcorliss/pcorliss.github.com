Welcome to the 50 projects Blog. For those curious, check out the <a href="http://blog.50projects.com/p/about-phil.html">about page</a> for the full details on what's going on. In short, every week I'll be starting a new project that will focus on something new and will use a wide array of different languages and technologies. I'll be working on an idea from initial research and development all the way to release and marketing. Every Monday morning I'll move on to a new idea.<br /><br />It's going to be an exciting year. I hope you folks enjoy following my progress, and hopefully you'll get some use out of these projects.</div>

I'm in the enviable position of having completed the bulk of the work for this project ahead of schedule. But the big features listed are running and working correctly. I've even gotten the initial prototype up on github.<br /><br /><a href="https://github.com/pcorliss/AbuseJet">https://github.com/pcorliss/AbuseJet</a><br /><br />More work still needs to be done, documentation, alerts, reporting, etc....<br /><br />In the meantime enjoy.</div>

<div class='post'>
An early prototype of the Ruby interface for Amazon's Route 53 is available on <a href="https://github.com/pcorliss/ruby_route_53">github</a> and as the <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/route53">route53 gem</a>. You can install the gem by typing the following.<br /><code><br />gem install route53<br /></code><br />There isn't any documentation and the <strike>command line interface isn't done yet</strike> but this should get folks started that want to create a zone or two along with some simple records.<br /><br /><a href="https://github.com/pcorliss/ruby_route_53">https://github.com/pcorliss/ruby_route_53</a><br /><a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/route53">https://rubygems.org/gems/route53</a><br /><br /><b>Edit: </b>No longer a prototype <a href="http://blog.50projects.com/2010/12/amazon-route-53-interface-friday.html">http://blog.50projects.com/2010/12/amazon-route-53-interface-friday.html</a></div>

Project Summary: This is an initial project to set up the infrastructure necessary for me to be successful and stay focused over the coming year. Not a traditional project so much as a pre-project: hence the name Project Zero.<br /><ul><li>Purchase and construct a desk and chair</li><li>Purchase and construct a new workstation</li><li>Setup 50projects.com domain, sub domains, blog and site</li><li>Design a logo</li><li>Research business cards and order if prudent</li><li>Write base copy for 50 projects</li><li>Spam network with links to the blog to get the word out</li></ul>Desk and Chair constructed yesterday. I managed to find a desk that was sturdy and suitably 'nice' at IKEA that didn't break the bank. The chair is mighty comfy as well. Workstation components came in this afternoon, so I'll be spending this evening working on that.</div>
